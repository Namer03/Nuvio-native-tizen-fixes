/* ORIGINAL AUDIO WITH TORBOX BURN-IN (owners 13-14/11). While TorBox's burned
 * picture plays (tbburn.h), Settings > "Original audio with burn-in" picks:
 *
 *   PASSTHROUGH (default): the sound comes from the original file, read by
 *     Nuvio on ONE sequential connection (dts_engine_open_demux). A local
 *     HTTP server on 127.0.0.1 serves the TV a master playlist with one HLS
 *     audio rendition per audio track (2 s segments, on TorBox's timeline)
 *     and TorBox's video segments with TorBox's audio removed (vs.m3u8 ->
 *     v_<k>.ts; nothing is decoded). The S95C played TorBox's muxed audio
 *     whenever it was still in the video (14/11), so it has to go.
 *   TORBOX AUDIO: no session; TorBox's stream (its transcoded audio) as is.
 *
 * Audio by codec: AAC / AC3 / E-AC3 / Opus / MP3 copied into MPEG-TS; DTS,
 * TrueHD/MLP converted to AC3 (5.1 640 kb/s, 2.0 192 kb/s); FLAC copied as is
 * into fragmented-MP4 segments (MPEG-TS has no FLAC; the S95C plays it). The
 * FLAC conversion stays in the code (tba_definir_flac) with no menu row.
 *
 * Connections: the original file 1 + one TorBox segment download at a time.
 * Audio generation is serialized; a segment the player hung up on, or left
 * for another position, is dropped. Seeks go through the indexed stream.
 * Nothing here logs a URL (TorBox's carry its token).
 *
 * Only the .tpk built with FFmpeg has the server; elsewhere the calls are
 * stubs (tba_disponivel() == 0). The playlist helpers are pure and compile
 * everywhere (tests/tbaudio.sh). */
